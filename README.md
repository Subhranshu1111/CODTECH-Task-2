Overview of the Project
Project: Creating a weather forecast webpage

Creating a weather forecast webpage involves several steps, including obtaining weather data from an API, displaying this data on a webpage, and styling the webpage for a good user experience. Here's a step-by-step guide to building a simple weather forecast webpage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a weather API like OpenWeatherMap.

Step 1: Obtain an API Key
First, sign up for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap. You will need this key to fetch weather data.

Step 2: Create the HTML Structure
Start by creating the HTML file that will hold the structure of your webpage.
Step 3: Style the Webpage
Next, add some basic styling to make your webpage look presentable.
Step 4: Add Functionality with JavaScript
Finally, add JavaScript to fetch and display weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Putting It All Together
Create a folder for your project.
Inside this folder, create three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
Copy the respective code into each file.
Replace YOUR_API_KEY in script.js with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
Open index.html in a web browser.
You should now have a functional weather forecast webpage. You can enter a city name and click "Get Weather" to fetch and display the current weather data for that city.

Additional Features
You can enhance this basic weather forecast webpage with more features, such as:

Displaying a weather icon.
Adding error handling for invalid city names.
Showing a loading indicator while fetching data.
Displaying a 5-day weather forecast.
